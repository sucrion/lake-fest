# Summer Lake Fest: Demo Site
This is a demo site for an event - a summer lake festival. It features a variety of activities and vendors, which can be read about on different pages. The bright colours and overlapping shapes were designed to reflect the energy of the event. All copy was written by me.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, Inkscape

The site was mostly built from scratch and by hand using HTML, CSS, and JS. The images were edited in Photoshop and style elements were created using Inkscape.

## Optimizations

Some of the pages providing additional information are not as intuitive as they could be - a fix would be to add text suggesting the user click on a button to find out more, or having one of the tabs pre-opened on load.

Another major optimization concerns the calendar: as of now, it is an embedded Google Calendar, which is not ideal. It does not fit aesthetically and is not too easy to use. As such, a more navigable (and prettier) calendar would be a huge improvement. There should also be something like a downloadable version of the calendar (e.g., as a PDF or image). 

## Lessons Learned

This was a relatively big site for me as I created it. Though it, I learned a lot about managing many different files and keeping them organized, along with new techniques I hadn't used before (creating tabs like on the vendor/competitions pages, notably). I also learned to work with SVGs, which I hadn't used previously - for example, I struggled with their sizes before I learned how to stop them from forcing their initial proportions.
